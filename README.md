# Crypto Option pricing model using Binomial Tree and Monte Carlo simulation

## About

This project will discover option valuation with different approaches. Three most popular approaches will be used to price Vanilla European Put Option of a special asset - Crypto named Polkadot. 

## Polkadot Overview
This report is analyzed price DOT-USD movement in the period of Sep 2020-Aug 2022.

### Descriptive analysis on Polka Dot price during chosen period:
Period	Mean	Std	Min	Max	25%	50%	75%
Sep 2020-Dec 2022	20.13	12.60	3.76	8.13	8.13	18.34	29.61

### Technical analysis
•	Log Return is one of three methods used to calculate asset’s return, assuming that returns are continuously compounded. It is calculated by taking the natural log of the ending value divided by the beginning value.
In crypto world, since the volatility is extremely higher compared to other assets (stocks), this report is using 3 months data (Jun 2022-Aug 2022) to calculate Polka Dot log return, instead of 1 year to archie more accurate and updated impact.
As calculated, the log-return of Polka Dot from the 3month-annalysied period is -0.0030

•	Annualized volatility is statistical and historical volatility, based on historical prices and represents the fluctuations of underlying asset by measuring price changes over predetermined periods of time. 
In this case, from the figure 2, there is a bit higher fluctuation in 15 Jun (8.5103) compared to other time in that period, means the volatility is higher and Polka Dot price ranging further away from the standard deviation. 
Formula: 	vol = σ√T
As calculated, the annualized volatility of Polka Dot Jun-Aug/2022 period is 97.39%

## Option Pricing Models
This report is for the sell-side, writing Vanilla European Put Option. The option pricing will be calculated, analyzed and decided with application of Binomial Tree model and Monte-Carlo Simulation, based on following figures:    	
	Note	Details 
Spot price	Adjust close price on 30/08/2022	#S: 7.00
Strike price		#K: 8.00
Time to maturity 	1 week	#T: 1/52
Interest rate	Source: US. 10 Year Treasury Rate, 
updated Apr 2022	#r: 0.03

Volatility	Calculated using 3months-data of Jun-Aug 2022	#σ: 97.39% or 0.97

### Binomial Tree
The binomial option pricing model uses an iterative procedure, producing the specification of nodes in time during the time period between the valuation date and the date to maturity. At every step, the asset price either goes up or goes down, hence the model predicts and creates a binomial distribution of underlying asset prices. Therefore, it represents theoretically possible paths that the asset price will take in the option period.
Consequently, the option prices at each step of Binomial tree are calculated backward from expiration to the present. Any changes to asset prices or option value are considered to figure out the result at specific node in time.
	Step 1: Creating Binomial tree by working forward from valuation date to expiration. The up and down factors are calculated with following formula:

	Step 2: Finding option value at each final node
 
	Step 3: Finding option value at earlier node using risk-neutral probability
p=  (e^rδt  -v)/(u-v).

Polka Dot has spot price of $7, put option strike price of $8, one-week expiration date, and interest rate (r) of 3%. The option price is calculated on each node according to the Polka Dot prices moving on each node. When price move above strike price - node 3,1 – the option will be worthless hence the option price is 0. In the other hands, when the price movement is still below the strike price, the put option is in-out-money, therefore having the according values stated on figure 3. 
Based on the Bionimal Tree model, the option price for chosen European put is computationally calculated as 1.0868.

### Monte-carlo simulation
Computational modelling is used in Monte Carlo simulation to forecast results. A random number is initially produced by the model using a probability distribution. The stock price is then generated by the random number using the extra inputs of volatility and time to expiration. The value of the option is then determined using the produced stock price at the time of expiration. The program then repeatedly estimates outcomes using a new set of random values drawn from the probability functions. Before it is finished, a Monte Carlo simulation may require thousands of computations, depending on the model, the amount of uncertainty, and the probability distributions utilised. The average of all the estimated results is often used by Monte Carlo simulation for option models as the option price.
In setup the underlying of the option to be valued follows the stochastic differential equation. 			dS_t=rS_t dt+ σS_t dW_t
This stochastic differential equation can be discretized over equidistant time intervals and simulated according to the following equation, which represents an Euler scheme. In this case, z is a standard normally distributed random number. For M time intervals (M = 1000), the length of the time interval is given as ∆t≡T/M where T is the time horizon for the simulation (for example, the maturity date of an option to be valued).
S_t=S_(t-∆t)  exp⁡((r-σ^2/2)∆t+ σ√∆t z)

The frequencies of different outcomes generated by this simulation will form a normal distribution, that is, a bell curve. The most likely return is in the middle of the curve, meaning there is an equal chance that the actual return will be higher or lower.

Based on the Monte Carlo Simulation model, the option price for chosen European put is computational calculated as 1.0603.
